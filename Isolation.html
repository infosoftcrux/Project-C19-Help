						<div class="wp-block-column">
							<p>If you or someone in your house has tested positive for Corona, there is no need to worry
								or panic. In this difficult moment, you are not alone. We are with you, and together we
								can help you to return to good health. This is why our doctors are currently advising
								patients with mild symptoms to home-isolate for 17 days. If your doctor has advised you
								to self-isolate, kindly follow the instructions given below strictly.</p>

							<p><strong>Before starting the process of home-isolation, please follow these critical
									instructions carefully</strong></p>

							<p>A separate well-ventilated room and a separate toilet should be available for Corona
								patient at your home. If not, please inform your doctor about this, we will make
								arrangements in “COVID Care Centre” for the patient.<br>A caregiver/attendant should be
								available 24×7 for the care of the patient.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="wp-block-column">
							<p>If anybody in your house is above 55 years of age, is pregnant or has any severe medical
								condition like cancer, severe asthma, respiratory disorders, diabetes, high blood
								pressure, cardiovascular disease, renal disease etc please shift them to another house
								till the patient recovers. In such situations it is not safe to home quarantine a Corona
								patient in your house, as it can be dangerous for anyone with a serious health
								condition.<br></p>

							<p>CM Sh. Arvind Kejriwal has appointed a team of health workers and doctors who will call
								the patient on a daily basis to monitor their health. Please make sure you attend all
								their calls and give them accurate information about the patient.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Please download the Arogya Setu App on your mobile phone and enable notifications
									and location tracking on the app at all times.</li>
								<li>Wear a triple layer medical mask at all times. Discard the mask after 8 hours of
									use. Kindly replace the mask if it becomes wet or visibly soiled. Before disposing a
									mask kindly disinfect it with 1% Sodium Hypochlorite solution.</li>
								<li>1% sodium hypochlorite solution can easily be made at home using sodium hypochlorite
									bleach (containing 3.5% chlorine) or bleaching powder (containing 70% chlorine). In
									order to make 1% sodium hypochlorite solution, mix 1 litre of sodium hypochlorite
									bleach in 2.5 litre water or 7 gms of bleaching powder in 1 liter of water. The
									following should be kept in mind while using this solution:</li>
								<li>Always wear mask and gloves while using this solution.</li>
								<li>This solution can be used for cleaning of floors or high contact surfaces like
									switch boards, windows, doorknobs, chairs, dining table, cupboard etc</li>
								<li>This solution should never be sprayed directly onto the toilet surface. It should be
									sprayed on a cloth and then used for cleaning the toilet.</li>
								<li>This solution should not be used to clean metallic surfaces like door handles,
									security locks etc as it can lead to rusting. Other alcohol-based sanitizer should
									be used for disinfecting such surfaces.</li>
								<li>Keep all windows in your room open. Ensure that your room is as well ventilated as
									possible at all times.</li>
								<li>Please strictly remain inside your room for the entire duration of your home
									isolation. By moving around the house and accidentally touching surfaces like doors,
									windows and tables, you risk infecting other people in your house.</li>
							</ul>

						</div>



						<div class="wp-block-column">
							<ul>
								<li>Use only the dedicated toilet assigned to you, and if your toilet has a lid, always

									adequate hydration.</li>
								<li>Eat three healthy low carbohydrate, high protein meals per day consisting of
									adequate vegetables and fruits. (Kindly refer to the nutrition chart guide.) Always
									cough or sneeze directly into your mask, handkerchief or into your elbow.</li>
								<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 40 seconds or clean them with
									an alcohol-based sanitizer.</li>
								<li>Do not share personal items like utensils, towels etc. with the other family
									members.</li>
								<li>Frequently clean surfaces in your room like table tops, doorknobs, handles, mobile
									phones, computers, remotes, etc. that are touched often. Clean them using the 1%
									hypo-chlorite solution or a suitable sanitizer.</li>
								<li>Strictly follow medication as prescribed by your doctor. Consult your doctor if you
									are taking regular medication for any other health condition.</li>
								<li>Avoid alcohol and quit smoking during the isolation process.</li>
							</ul>

							<p><strong>Understand that the process is physical isolation and not emotional
									isolation</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Keep in touch with family members, relatives and friends over phone/video call.</li>
								<li>Catch up on your favourite TV shows, movies, read books, listen to music or play
