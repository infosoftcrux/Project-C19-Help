					<h2 class="heading">COVID-19 advice for the public: Getting vaccinated</h2>

					<div class="sf-content-block content-block">
						<div>
							<p>The world is in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic. As WHO and partners work together on
								the response -- tracking the pandemic, advising on critical interventions, distributing
								vital medical supplies to those in need--- they are racing to develop and deploy safe
								and effective vaccines.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Vaccines save millions of lives each year. Vaccines work by training and preparing the
								body’s natural defences&nbsp;– the immune system&nbsp;– to recognize and fight off the
								viruses and bacteria they target. After vaccination, if the body is later exposed to
								those disease-causing germs, the body is immediately ready to destroy them, preventing
								illness.<br></p>
							<p><strong>There are several safe and effective vaccines that prevent people from getting
									seriously ill or dying from COVID-19. </strong>This<strong> </strong>is one part of
								managing COVID-19, in addition to the main preventive measures of staying at least 1
								metre away from others, covering a cough or sneeze in your elbow, frequently cleaning
								your hands, wearing a mask and avoiding poorly ventilated rooms or opening a window.
								<br>
							</p>
							<p>As of&nbsp; 8 April 2021, WHO has evaluated that the following vaccines against COVID-19
								have met the necessary criteria for safety and efficacy:<br></p>
							<ul>

							</ul>
							<p><br></p>
							<p> The Emergency Use Listing process to find out more about how WHO assesses the quality,
								safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. <br></p>
							<p>Some national regulators have also assessed other COVID-19 vaccine products for use in
								their countries. <br></p>
							<p><strong>Take whatever vaccine is made available to you first, even if you have already
									had COVID-19. It is important to be vaccinated as soon as possible once it’s your
									turn and not wait. </strong>Approved COVID-19 vaccines provide a high degree of
								protection against getting seriously ill and dying from the disease, although no vaccine
								is 100% protective. <strong></strong><br></p>
							<p><strong>WHO SHOULD GET VACCINATED</strong><br></p>
							<p><strong>The COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people 18 years and olde<a
										name="OLE_LINK106" data-sf-ec-immutable="">r, </a></strong>including those with
								pre-existing conditions of any kind, including auto-immune disorders. These conditions
								include: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as
								chronic infections that are stable and controlled. <br></p>
							<p>If supplies are limited in your area, discuss your situation with your care provider if
								you:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Have a compromised immune system</li>
								<li>Are pregnant (if you are already breastfeeding, you should continue after
									vaccination) </li>
								<li>Have a history of severe allergies, particularly to a vaccine (or any of the
									ingredients in the vaccine)</li>
								<li>Are severely frail <br></li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>Children should not be vaccinated for the moment.</strong><br></p>
							<p>There is not yet enough evidence on the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in children to
								make recommendations for children to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Children and
								adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults. However, children should
								continue to have the recommended childhood vaccines. <br></p>
							<p><strong>WHAT SHOULD I DO AND EXPECT AFTER GETTING VACCINATED</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Stay at the place where you get vaccinated for at least 15 minutes
									afterwards</strong>, just in case you have an unusual reaction, so health workers
								can help you.&nbsp; </p>
							<p><strong>Check when you should come in for a second dose – if needed. </strong>Most of the
								vaccines available are two-dose vaccines. Check with your care provider whether you need
								to get a second dose and when you should get it. Second doses help boost the immune
								response and strengthen immunity. <strong></strong><br></p>
							<p><strong>In most cases, minor side effects are normal. </strong>Common side effects after
								vaccination, which indicate that a person's body is building protection to COVID-19
								infection include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Arm soreness</li>
								<li>Mild fever</li>
								<li>Tiredness</li>
								<li>Headaches</li>
								<li>Muscle or joint aches</li>
							</ul>
							<p><br></p>
							<p>Contact your care provider if there is redness or tenderness (pain) where you got the
								shot that increases after 24 hours, or if side effects do not go away after a few days.
								<br>
							</p>
							<p>If you experience an immediate severe allergic reaction to a first dose of the COVID-19
								vaccine, you should not receive additional doses of the vaccine. It’s extremely rare for
								severe health reactions to be directly caused by vaccines.<br></p>
							<p>Taking painkillers such as paracetamol before receiving the COVID-19 vaccine to prevent
								side effects is not recommended. This is because it is not known how painkillers may
								affect how well the vaccine works. However, you may take paracetamol or other
								painkillers if you do develop side effects such as pain, fever, headache or muscle aches
								after vaccination. &nbsp;<br></p>
							<p><strong>Even after you’re vaccinated, keep taking precautions </strong><br></p>
							<p>While a COVID-19 vaccine will prevent serious illness and death, we still don’t know the
								extent to which it keeps you from being infected and passing the virus on to others. The
								more we allow the virus to spread, the more opportunity the virus has to change. <br>
							</p>
							<p>Continue to take actions to slow and eventually stop the spread of the virus: <br></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Keep at least 1 metre from others </li>
								<li>Wear a mask, especially in crowded, closed and poorly ventilated settings. </li>
								<li>Clean your hands frequently</li>
								<li>Cover any cough or sneeze in your bent elbow </li>
								<li>When indoors with others, ensure good ventilation, such as by opening a window</li>
